# 🧠 Project Planning: Final Prep Tasks & Ideas

This document outlines the final planning and preparation tasks required before building the full multi-agent blog automation system. It includes both user-defined tasks and additional roadmap recommendations.

---

## ✅ Upcoming Planning & Implementation Tasks (User-defined)

### 1. 🗂 README File for Agents
- Explain file structure and directory purpose
- Describe `.env`, `workflow_state.json`, metadata files, etc.
- Provide agent-specific guidance on how to read/write/update files

### 2. 🧱 Broad Implementation Plan (Setup & Build Phases)
- Define sequential build phases (infra setup, agents, dashboard, etc.)
- Each phase will be broken into detailed task lists later

### 3. 🤖 Agent Instructions for Implementation
- Provide agents with a master instruction sheet
- Include prompt templates to guide user through manual steps

### 4. ✨ Clean Template Generation Instructions
- Instruct agent to analyze the current repo
- Strip out test-specific or legacy data, replace with template values
- Ensure:
  - Folder structure is preserved and documented
  - Agent instructions are templated and reviewed
  - Only clean code, data schemas, and `.env.example` remain
- Include review checklist: instructions, file/folder structure, codebase, configuration files

### 5. 🚚 Template Migration Instructions
- Provide guide for next agent to fork or copy the template
- Step-by-step instructions to implement and personalize the system per project

## 🧩 Additional Recommendations Before Build Starts

### A. 🗺 Roadmap with Milestones
- Phase 1: Setup (GitHub, Supabase, n8n, Cursor)
- Phase 2: SEO Agent + Trigger Chain
- Phase 3: Blog Agent + Review Agent + Image Agent
- Phase 4: Dashboard & User Interactions
- Phase 5: Social + Publishing + Analytics

### B. 📊 Analytics Schema Plan
- Decide on metrics to track: views, clickthroughs, conversion proxies, image performance, agent runtime, etc.
- Define DB fields or tracking scripts

### C. 🔐 Access & Auth Plan
- Decide on Supabase Auth (for private dashboards)
- Identify public vs private features
- Optional: Invite-based access to hub for multiple properties

### D. 🧪 Test & QA Framework
- Linting, basic tests for agent outputs
- Markdown linting, metadata validation
- Option for visual snapshot tests of dashboards or outputs

### E. 📤 Deployment Plan
- GitHub → Cloudflare Pages w/ preview + main branches
- Decide where/how Supabase + Webhooks are hosted
