## üìä Content Types & Structure

### Blog Post Types

- Always include the `amazon-link` class for proper styling
- Include tracking tag: `tag=bright-gift-20`
- **Affiliate ID:** Always use `bright-gift-20` for all Amazon links.
- **How to construct a search link:**
  - Use: `https://www.amazon.com/s?k=[search-keywords]&tag=bright-gift-20`
  - Replace `[search-keywords]` with plus-separated product keywords (e.g., `plant+stand`)
  - Example: `<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=plant+stand&tag=bright-gift-20" class="amazon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View on Amazon</a>`

### Afrofiliate Links (Black-Owned Businesses)
- Format: `<a href="https://www.arjdj2msd.com/7LKLK3/[BRAND_CODE]/" class="amazon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop [Brand Name]</a>`
- Use "Shop [Brand Name]" as the anchor text
- Always include the `amazon-link` class for consistent styling
- **Brand Codes:**
  - BeautyStat: `QWRG9C`
  - Furi Sport: `R2Z4H6`
  - Be Rooted: `R74QP1`
  - Kadalys: `RC9DWS`
  - Be Yourself 314: `24BMB4P`
  - Endorf: `24D26TB`
  - Caribe Coffee: `24R58Q6`
  - Cashblack UK: `2CTPL1`
  - Cashblack US: `M823SF`
- **When to use:** Include Afrofiliate brands in relevant gift guides (skincare, athletic wear, stationery, wellness, coffee)
- **Example:** `<a href="https://www.arjdj2msd.com/7LKLK3/QWRG9C/" class="amazon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shop BeautyStat</a>`

### Bookshop.org Links
- **Affiliate ID:** Use `brightgift` for all Bookshop.org links
- **Direct Book Links (Preferred):** Use when you have the book's ISBN
  - Format: `<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/brightgift/ISBN" class="amazon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View on Bookshop.org</a>`
  - Example: `<a href="https://bookshop.org/a/brightgift/9780525559474" class="amazon-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener">View on Bookshop.org</a>`
- **Search Links (Fallback):** Use when ISBN is not available

  ```
  *This post contains affiliate links. We may earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase, at no additional cost to you.*
  ```

> **üìñ For detailed Bookshop.org linking guidelines, see [bookshop-blog-linking-guide.md](./bookshop-blog-linking-guide.md)**

### Natural Gift Selection Guidelines
- **Prioritize Quality Over Platform Diversity:** Choose the best gift for the recipient, regardless of which affiliate platform it's available on. Don't artificially balance Amazon vs Bookshop.org vs Afrofiliate links if it compromises gift quality.
- **Context-Appropriate Recommendations:** For book-focused gift guides, naturally include more Bookshop.org links. For gadget or accessory guides, naturally include more Amazon links. For Black-owned business guides, naturally include more Afrofiliate links.
- **Authentic Curation:** Each gift should feel genuinely recommended, not included just to meet affiliate platform quotas. If a gift doesn't fit the recipient's interests or the guide's theme, don't include it.
- **User-First Approach:** Remember that readers are looking for genuinely helpful gift suggestions. Their satisfaction and trust are more valuable than maximizing affiliate link variety.
- **Afrofiliate Integration:** When creating content about skincare, athletics, wellness, coffee, or stationery, naturally include relevant Afrofiliate brands (BeautyStat, Furi Sport, Endorf, Caribe Coffee, Be Rooted) as they offer high-quality products from Black-owned businesses.
