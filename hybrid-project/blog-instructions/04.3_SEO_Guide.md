- Use `target="_blank" rel="noopener"` for external links
- Ensure all affiliate links are properly disclosed

### Affiliate Link Optimization
- **Amazon Format:** `https://www.amazon.com/s?k=[keywords]&tag=bright-gift-20`
- **Bookshop.org Format:** `https://bookshop.org/a/brightgift/[ISBN]` (direct) or `https://bookshop.org/search?keywords=[keywords]&affiliate=brightgift` (search)
- **Afrofiliate Format:** `https://www.arjdj2msd.com/7LKLK3/[BRAND_CODE]/`
- **Tracking:** Always use `bright-gift-20` for Amazon, `brightgift` for Bookshop.org, Afrofiliate codes for Black-owned businesses
- **Anchor Text:** "View on Amazon", "View on Bookshop.org", or "Shop [Brand Name]" for consistency
- **Disclosure:** Required at the top of posts with affiliate links
- **Natural Selection:** Prioritize the best gift for the recipient, regardless of affiliate platform. Don't force platform diversity if it compromises gift quality or relevance.
- **Black-Owned Business Integration:** Include Afrofiliate brands in relevant gift guides to support diverse entrepreneurs

  - BeautyStat: `QWRG9C`
  - Furi Sport: `R2Z4H6`

### Content Quality & Natural Gift Selection
- **User-First Approach:** Content should prioritize genuine value to readers over affiliate optimization. Each gift recommendation should feel authentic and helpful.
- **Context-Appropriate Platform Selection:** 
  - Book-focused guides naturally include more Bookshop.org links
  - Tech/gadget guides naturally include more Amazon links
  - Black-owned business guides naturally include more Afrofiliate links
  - Don't artificially balance platforms if it doesn't serve the reader
- **Quality Over Quantity:** Better to have fewer, genuinely excellent gift suggestions than to force inclusion of mediocre options for platform diversity
- **Authentic Curation:** Every gift should have a clear, compelling reason for inclusion that serves the reader's needs, not just affiliate goals
- **Trust Building:** Readers who find genuinely helpful content are more likely to return and engage with affiliate links, creating better long-term value than forced diversity
- **Afrofiliate Integration:** When creating content about skincare, athletics, wellness, coffee, or stationery, naturally include relevant Afrofiliate brands as they offer high-quality products from Black-owned businesses

### Content Mix Strategy & Diversification
- **60% Gift Guides** (current strength - niche, budget, occasion-based)
- **25% Educational/How-To** (new focus - psychology, etiquette, problem-solving)
- **10% Data-Driven** (authority building - statistics, trends, analysis)
- **5% Seasonal/Trending** (timely relevance - holidays, current trends)

### Content Diversification Benefits
- **Long-tail Keywords:** Educational content captures specific search intent
- **Evergreen Value:** How-to guides remain relevant year-round
- **Featured Snippets:** Problem-solving content often gets featured in Google
- **Internal Linking:** Natural opportunities to link to your gift generator
- **Social Sharing:** Educational content gets shared more than pure product lists
- **Authority Building:** Establishes you as a gift-giving expert
- **SEO Diversity:** Reduces reliance on gift guide keywords alone
